# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various **LeetCode** problems that I have solved in different programming languages, primarily Java. Each solution is organized in its respective folder according to the problem number and name. The repository is a work in progress, and I will continue adding solutions as I solve more problems.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in a dedicated folder with the following structure:

- ```bash
    leetcode/
       | _ProblemNumber/ProblemName
           |_ SolutionFile.java
           |_ README.md


- **ProblemNumber.ProblemName**: Each folder is named based on the LeetCode problem number and title for easier navigation.
- **SolutionFile.java**: The main solution file for the problem, typically written in Java. Other languages may be added in the future.
- **README.md**: A markdown file providing an explanation of the problem, approach, time complexity, and instructions on how to run the solution.

More problem's will be added as I continue solving them on LeetCode.

## How to Use 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/dinesh776/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
2. Navigate to the folder containing the specific problem solution you'd like to review:
    ```bash
    cd leetcode/SolutionFolderName(Replace with Preferred Folder Name)
3. Compile and run the solution:
    ```bash
   javac SolutionFile.java
    java SolutionFile

Each solution folder has detailed instructions on how to run the specific code for that problem.
