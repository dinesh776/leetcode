# Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

## Problem Description

**LeetCode Problem 1838:** [Frequency of the Most Frequent Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/description/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you can increment the value of any element in `nums` by `1` at most `k` times. Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing the increment operations optimally.

### Example

```[]
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment 1 two times and 2 one time to make nums = [4,4,4]. The frequency of 4 is 3.
```

## Solution

This problem can be efficiently solved using a **sliding window** technique:

1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting helps us handle elements in increasing order.
2. **Sliding Window:** Expand the window to the right, adding elements to the total sum.
3. **Shrink Window if Invalid:** If the cost to make all elements in the window equal exceeds `k`, move the left pointer.
4. **Track the Maximum Frequency:** Update the result with the largest valid window size.

## Code Implementation

```java[]
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FrequencyOfTheMostFrequentElement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 4};
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(maxFrequency(nums, k));
    }

    public static int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0;
        long total = 0;
        int result = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            total += nums[right];

            // Check if the current window is valid
            while ((long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1) > total + k) {
                total -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }

            // Update the result with the maximum window size
            result = Math.max(result, right - left + 1);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Sorting the Array:** Allows us to focus on making elements equal to the largest element in the window.
2. **Calculating Total Cost:** `(nums[right] * window_size)` is the target sum. If this exceeds `total + k`, shrink the window.
3. **Result Update:** Track the maximum valid window size, which gives the highest frequency.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N log N)` due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` for constant space usage.

This is an optimal approach for solving the problem within the given constraints.
